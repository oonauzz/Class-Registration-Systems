# University Course Registration System using OOP

## Description

This repository contains the solution for Homework One of the Data Structures course at New York University's Computer Science Department. The assignment focuses on building a University Course Registration System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

Instructor: Dr. Anasse Bari.

## Learning Objectives

    Designing and engineering a software solution using OOP
    Practicing Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Method Overriding, Method Overloading, and Polymorphism.
    Sorting of Objects
    Practicing Abstraction (Abstract Data Types, the ArrayList class, Lists…)
    File/IO in Java
    Serialization and Binary Files in Java

## Guidelines

    Attach the Java source files and include them in the HW’s zip file.
    Make an archive with all the java files (the .java files NOT the .class files).
    Comment your code (basic comments explaining the role of a class, a method, or variables used in your submission).
    Compile and run the program before submission.
    Ensure the Zip file contains your actual latest files.
