# University Course Registration System using OOP

## Description

This repository contains the solution for Homework One of the Data Structures course at New York University's Computer Science Department. The assignment focuses on building a University Course Registration System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
Instructor: Dr. Anasse Bari

## Learning Objectives

    Designing and engineering a software solution using OOP
    Practicing Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Method Overriding, Method Overloading, and Polymorphism.
    Sorting of Objects
    Practicing Abstraction (Abstract Data Types, the ArrayList class, Lists…)
    File/IO in Java
    Serialization and Binary Files in Java

## Guidelines

    Attach the Java source files and include them in the HW’s zip file. File name should be YourLastName_HW1.zip.
    Make an archive with all the java files (the .java files NOT the .class files) and post it on NYU Classes.
    Comment your code (basic comments explaining the role of a class, a method, or variables used in your submission).
    Compile and run the program before submission.
    Ensure the Zip file contains your actual latest files. Double-check by sending the file to yourself via email before uploading it on NYU classes.
    Failure to open the file will result in a grade of zero.
    Submitting .class files instead of .java files (source files) will result in a grade of zero.
    Cheating will result in an immediate zero on the homework, and a report to the academic advisor and administration.
    50% point deduction for exercises that do not compile and run correctly.
    Plagiarized assignments will receive a ZERO grade. Each student must provide their own solution, without copying from internet sources.
