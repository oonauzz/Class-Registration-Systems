# University Course Registration System using OOP

## Description

This repository contains the solution for a Course Registration System (CRS) developed as part of a programming exercise for a university course. The system is designed to manage course registration for students and administrative tasks for university staff.

Instructor: Dr. Anasse Bari.

## Functional Requirements

    Store information about each course, including course name, ID, maximum number of students, current number of registered students, instructor, section number, and location.
    Allow two types of users: Admin and Student.
    Admin tasks include course management (create, delete, edit courses), viewing course information, registering students, and generating reports.
    Student tasks include viewing available courses, registering for courses, withdrawing from courses, and viewing their enrolled courses.
    Implement interfaces for Admin and Student classes, both inheriting from a User class.
    Read course information from a CSV file into an ArrayList of Course objects at program launch.
    Use serialization to store and retrieve ArrayLists of Course and Student objects.

## Non-Functional Requirements

    Provide an overall design of the software, specifying classes, interfaces, relationships, and workflows.
    Explain the implementation of key concepts such as method overloading, method overriding, abstract classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstract data types (ADT).

## Learning Objectives

    Designing and engineering a software solution using OOP
    Practicing Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Method Overriding, Method Overloading, and Polymorphism.
    Sorting of Objects
    Practicing Abstraction (Abstract Data Types, the ArrayList class, Lists…)
    File/IO in Java
    Serialization and Binary Files in Java

## Guidelines

    Attach the Java source files and include them in the HW’s zip file.
    Make an archive with all the java files (the .java files NOT the .class files).
    Comment your code (basic comments explaining the role of a class, a method, or variables used in your submission).
    Compile and run the program before submission.
    Ensure the Zip file contains your actual latest files.
